# HMM_WritingReader

I created a program which can be trained to match the users handwriting with a specified character using Hidden Markov Models. 
Once trained, the program predicts the most likely character being drawn in the UI.
The text in the top left of the program shows the character being trained in training mode and the most probable guessed character when in prediction mode.

Usage:
Install the Processing IDE to open and run hmm_drawing.pde
- To Train:
1. Hold the alphanumeric key you wish to train recognition for
2. Simultaneously draw this character in the UI by holding Left Click and dragging the cursor
- To Predict:
1. Draw a character by holding Left Click and dragging the cursor
2. See the Most Likely Prediction in the top left of the UI
